Lists are important for structured information. There is nothing hard in the creation of lists in Markdown. Just insert an asterisk (`*`) or a dash (`-`) before each item for an unordered list or a number with a dot for an ordered one (e.g., 1., 2., 3.).

### Unordered lists

Here is an example of an unordered list:

    * item1
    * item2
    * item3

And it will be transformed to something like this:

* item1
* item2
* item3

Dashes work as well:

    - first item with dash
    - second item with dash

Goes to:

- first item with dash
- second item with dash

### Ordered lists

Here is an example of a simple ordered list:

    1. item1
    2. item2
    3. item3

Which will be transformed into:

1. item1
2. item2
3. item3

As you may see, this notation is very intuitive and readable.

### Nested lists

There is nothing hard about making a nested list. Just add a tab, or spaces for nested elements such as:

    - element 1
      - element 1.1
      - element 1.2
    - element 2
      - element 2.1
    - element 3

For lists with `*` and ordered lists it works as well.

## THE CHALLENGE

In the new file add a first-level heading with `Lists` as content.

Try to write your own list. Please create a new file and create an unordered list in it:

- One
  - 1.1
  - 1.2
- Two
  - 2.1
  - 2.2
- Three
- Four
- Five

When you are done, please verify your solution.
