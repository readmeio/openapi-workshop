# Amazing!

References are very handy in cases when you have to write a big document, such as documentation for your project. If you have a lot of links and you want to easily manage them, you can create a section at the bottom of your file and leave all your references there. For example:

    A lot of text. Many [useful] and [important] information here.

    <!-- My References -->
    [useful]: http://useful.site
    [important]: https://important.site

Above, `<!-- My References -->` is an HTML-comment that will be omit. You can skip this comment, but actually it helps to recognize a section with references. This approach helps you to keep track of all of your links.

By the way, references also work for images as well!

In the next exercise we will take a look at images in Markdown.
