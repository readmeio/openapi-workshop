# Nice job!

Now you know how you can easily mark important parts in Markdown.

We suggest to use different notations for italic and bold, for example:

1. Single underscore for `_italic_` and double asterisks for `**bold**`
2. Single asterisk for `*italic*` and double underscores for `__bold__`

This approach helps to recognize different styles faster. For _**combined**_ you may mix styles such as `_**combined**_` or `*__combined__*` as well.

In the next exercise we will take a look at lists in Markdown.
