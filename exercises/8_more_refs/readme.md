Letâ€™s do one more `"$ref"` just for good measure! (We'll use it later)

**Instruction: Write a schema called "Squawk" that is identical to "Hoot"**

```
{
...
          "replyto": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Optional id of the hoot you're replying to"
          }
        }
      },
      "Squawk": "{ YOUR ANSWER HERE }"
    },
    "x-readme": {
      "explorer-enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```
