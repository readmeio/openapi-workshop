Let's do one more `"$ref"` just for good measure! Don't worry we'll use it again later.

### 👩‍🏫 Instructions

Write a schema called "Squawk" that is identical to "Hoot".

```
{
...
          "replyto": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Optional id of the hoot you're replying to"
          }
        }
      },
      "Squawk": "{ YOUR ANSWER HERE }"
    }
  }
}
```
