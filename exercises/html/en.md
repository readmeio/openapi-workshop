If you want to style something more than is allowed in Markdown, you can use raw HTML in your Markdown and it'll work pretty well.

    <p align="center">Centered text works well!</p>

And you will get a centered paragraph.

Sometimes it's helpful, but be careful! Markdown inside HTML won't be rendered! That means if you write something like this:

    <span>Markdown **won't** work here!</span>

It won't work.

## THE CHALLENGE

Add `HTML` as the first-level heading.

Below, use HTML for centering this text:
