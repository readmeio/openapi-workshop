### Warm Up Round: Changing a title in OAS

This one’s gonna be an easy one. We want you to change the title of the OAS spec file. This is more of a warm up round so you understand the mechanics of how this workshop works. Below, you’ll be given instructions for each exercise. You’ll also be given a starter JSON file. You can run the exercise against your work by running `openapi-workshop verify answers/2_warm_up_titles.json` in your terminal.

We have the basic template here. And the title is “Hoot”. You'll be given a copy of this to edit under the `/answers` directory.

```
{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "info": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "title": "Hoot",
    "license": {
      "name": "ISC"
    }
  },
  "servers": [
  ],
  "paths": {
  },
  "components": {
  }
}
```

**Instruction: Change the title from “Hoot” to “Hoot Hoot”**
