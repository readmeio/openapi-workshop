Welcome to **how-to-markdown**!

### What is Markdown?

First things first, let's consider what Markdown actually is.

**Markdown** - is a lightweight, easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format for styling all forms of writing around the Internet. Markdown helps to control the display of the document: formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, creating lists and so on.

Markdown was made by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) in 2004, with significant collaboration from [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/).

Markdown can be written in a basic text editor. It's an easy way to write text that easily translates into HTML. When you write in Markdown, you have to save the document with the `.md` or `.markdown` extensions.

We can use Markdown almost everywhere:

* **StackOverflow** uses Markdown for posts and comments.
* **GitHub** uses Markdown for discussions in issues and pull requests.
* **Reddit** uses Markdown for formatting comments.
* **Slack**, **Gitter** and other IM use Markdown for formatting messages.
* **Jekyll**, **Octopress**, **Hexo** and other static site tools use Markdown.
* **GitBook** uses Markdown for writing books.
* Many people prefer to use Markdown for writing their blogs.
* Documentations for many open source project are written in Markdown.
* **how-to-markdown** also uses Markdown for formatting exercises.

So, knowledge of Markdown is an important skill for modern developers. That's why you have to learn it.

### How to get Markdown?

There is no clearly defined Markdown standard. Markdown is just common rules on how to write readable and formatted text.

While Markdown is a minimal markup language and is easily read and edited with a normal text editor, there's no need in specially designed editors for writing files in Markdown. However, there are a few editors that preview the files with styles.

Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming languages (_JavaScript_, _Ruby_, _Python_, _PHP_, _Perl_, etc). In addition, many platforms and frameworks support Markdown out of the box. For example, Markdown plugins exist for every major blogging platform.

### How to use this workshopper?

It's easy to use this workshopper. In most cases, it's enough to use these three commands for interacting with this workshopper:

* `how-to-markdown run file.md` will serve a local server at `http://localhost:3000/` with a preview of `file.md`.
* `how-to-markdown verify file.md` will verify your file.
* `how-to-markdown help` shows a help message.

## THE CHALLENGE

You first challenge is pretty simple. Just create a new file (for example using `touch`) and add a single line:

    Hello, world!

If you already did this, run `how-to-markdown verify` to verify your solution or `how-to-markdown run` to run your file in the browser.
