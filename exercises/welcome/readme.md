Welcome to ReadMe's OpenAPI workshop! This will be a 30-60 minute introduction to the OpenAPI Specification (OAS).

We think learning OAS is a great way to maintain an API for yourself and your team. OAS can allow you to maintain an API in a logical fashion, and will allow you to use some tooling to easily document your API for consumption. 

But the learning curve is quite high. Usually, someone get's thrown into a complex OAS issue and they'll have to learn about it by fixing a bad bug. Hopefully, this structured series of exercises will help you build up some fundamental knowledge to get you started on your OAS journey. Or equip you with just enough knowledge to be dangerous 😈. 

Through this workshop you'll be completing tidy little assignments and will learn about the basics of what the OpenAPI specification is, why we think you should learn about it, and give you some basic tutorials to get you started on your way to making your own OpenAPI definition.

So make some coffee or tea (not included in this tutorial, sadly), hunker down, and let’s get started!
