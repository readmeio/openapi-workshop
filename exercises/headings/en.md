It's important to categorize information. That's when headings help.

If you need to add a heading, just type a `#` sign at the beginning of the line. The number of `#` is a heading level. For example:

    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2
    ### Heading 3
    #### Heading 4
    ##### Heading 5
    ###### Heading 6

As in HTML, there are 6 levels of headings. These headings will be transformed into `<h1>`-`<h6>` tags accordingly.

There are aliases for first and second-level headings. You will get a first-level heading if you type three `=` signs on the following line.
You can type three `-` on the following line to create a second-level heading. For example:

    Heading 1
    ===

    Heading 2
    ---

## THE CHALLENGE

Please create a first-level heading with `Markdown is awesome!` and then verify your solution.
