**âœ¨ Learn how to use the OpenAPI Specification the easy way! âœ¨**

We think learning OAS is a great way to maintain an API for yourself and your team. OAS can allow you to maintain an API in a logical fashion, and will allow you to use some tooling to easily document your API for consumption. 

But the learning curve is quite high. Usually, someone get's thrown into a complex OAS issue and they'll have to learn about it by fixing a bad bug. Hopefully, this structured series of exercises will help you build up some fundamental knowledge to get you started on your OAS journey. Or equip you with just enough knowledge to be dangerous ðŸ˜ˆ. 

> **_Textbook definition:_** **OAS** (OpenAPI Specification) is a specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services
